        "\n",
        "1. **Chunking**  \n",
        "   Splits long narrative `.txt` files into overlapping text chunks with metadata (title, chunk ID).\n",

        "2. **Embedding**  \n",
        "   Encodes each chunk using `sentence-transformers` for semantic vector representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Indexing**  \n",
        "   Stores chunk vectors in a FAISS index for fast similarity search. Saves metadata in parallel.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Retrieval**  \n",
        "   Retrieves top-k semantically similar chunks for a given question.  \n",
        "   If a year (e.g., 2021) is detected in the question, results from that year are prioritized.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **LLM Summarization**  \n",
        "   Combines retrieved chunks into a prompt and sends to OpenAI   \n",
        "   for grounded narrative answers. No hallucination — answers are limited to retrieved context.\n",

They failed to improve on their 9\\u20137 record from the previous season following a 23\\u201317 loss to the Seattle Seahawks in Week 12. They were eliminated from playoff contention for the first time since 2016 following a Week 16 loss to the Dallas Cowboys and finished with a dismal 4\\u201311\\u20131 record, the second-worst in the National Football Conference (NFC), and their worst since 2012. After starting 3\\u20134\\u20131 heading into their bye week and leading the NFC East, the Eagles would lose 7 of their last 8 games. Injuries and poor quarterback play were factors in their struggles in the season. On January 11, 2021, the Eagles announced head coach Doug Pederson would not return after the season, as he was dismissed the same day. For the first time since 1998, the Eagles failed to score 30 or more points in a single game the entire season. Their .281 winning percentage was their worst since 2012. Overall, Carson Wentz, statistically, had one of the poorest seasons by a quarterback in franchise history, throwing for 2,620 yards, 16 touchdowns, 15 interceptions, and completed just 57.4% of his passes (251 for 437) to go with his 72.8 passer rating. He also got sacked 50 times for 326 yards. On July 14, 2020, the city of Philadelphia placed a ban on large events for six months, meaning that the Eagles' home games would have no fans in attendance. However, starting in week 6, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney announced that the city would allow 7,500 fans to attend Eagles home games.

Roster changes Free agents Signings Departures Trades March 19: The Eagles traded a third-round pick in the 2020 NFL draft and a fifth-round pick in the 2020 NFL draft to the Detroit Lions for CB Darius Slay. April 25: The Eagles traded their sixth-round pick in the 2020 NFL draft, 190th overall, to the San Francisco 49ers for their sixth-round pick, 210th overall, and Marquise Goodwin Draft Notes The Eagles acquired one additional seventh-round selection, along with wide receiver DeSean Jackson, in a trade that sent their 2019 sixth-round selection to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. However, the Eagles made trades with the Atlanta Falcons and the New England Patriots involving both their own seventh-round selection and the one acquired from the Buccaneers. The Eagles acquired an additional fifth-round selection in a trade that sent one of their seventh-round selections and defensive end Michael Bennett to the Patriots. The Eagles acquired an additional sixth-round selection, along with linebacker Duke Riley, in a trade that sent one of their seventh-round selections and safety Johnathan Cyprien to the Falcons.

The Eagles traded a sixth-round selection to the Chicago Bears in exchange for running back Jordan Howard. As the result of the negative differential of free agent signings and departures that the Eagles experienced during the first wave of the 2019 free agency period, the team is projected to receive two compensatory selections for the 2020 draft. Free agent transactions that occurred after May 7, 2019, did not factor into the team's formula for determining compensatory selections. The Eagles traded a third-round and fifth-round selection in the 2020 NFL draft to the Detroit Lions for cornerback Darius Slay. Staff Final roster Preseason The Eagles' preseason schedule was announced on May 7, but was later cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Regular season Schedule The Eagles' 2020 schedule was announced on May 7. Note: Intra-division opponents are in bold text. Game summaries Week 1: at Washington Football Team In a near-reversal of the previous season's opener, the Eagles scored the first 17 points, only for the Washington Football Team to then shut their offense out for the remainder of the afternoon. Meanwhile, Washington's offense scored 27 unanswered points, and the defense sacked Carson Wentz eight times, recorded two interceptions, and forced three fumbles. With the loss, Philadelphia's six-game winning streak against Washington dating back to 2016 came to an end, and the Eagles lost the first game of the season for the first time since 2015. Week 2: vs. Los Angeles Rams The Eagles' struggles continued in their home opener against the Los Angeles Rams. An early fumble by Miles Sanders led to a Rams touchdown by Tyler Higbee.

After starting 3–4–1 heading into their bye week and leading the NFC East, the Eagles would lose 7 of their last 8 games. Injuries and poor quarterback play were factors in their struggles in the season. On January 11, 2021, the Eagles announced head coach Doug Pederson would not return after the season, as he was dismissed the same day. For the first time since 1998, the Eagles failed to score 30 or more points in a single game the entire season. Their .281 winning percentage was their worst since 2012. Overall, Carson Wentz, statistically, had one of the poorest seasons by a quarterback in franchise history, throwing for 2,620 yards, 16 touchdowns, 15 interceptions, and completed just 57.4% of his passes (251 for 437) to go with his 72.8 passer rating.

In Week 17, after a devastating home loss to the Arizona Cardinals, the Eagles lost control of their own destiny for the NFC East division title. In Week 18, after the Cowboys' victory against the Commanders and their own loss to the Giants, the Eagles were locked into the #5 seed. Even in victory, the Eagles had problems with a poor defense the entire season, which was ranked 26th out of 32; 8 of their 11 victories fell within one score, while they conversely suffered blowout losses to the playoff-bound 49ers and Cowboys, as well as the Giants by 3 scores. In fact, the Eagles defense allowed the third-most points of any team in the league, with over 428. The Eagles' late season woes continued into the playoffs, in which they were eliminated in the Wild Card round by the NFC South champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers in a 32–9 loss.

The Eagles traded a sixth-round selection to the Chicago Bears in exchange for running back Jordan Howard. As the result of the negative differential of free agent signings and departures that the Eagles experienced during the first wave of the 2019 free agency period, the team is projected to receive two compensatory selections for the 2020 draft. Free agent transactions that occurred after May 7, 2019, did not factor into the team's formula for determining compensatory selections. The Eagles traded a third-round and fifth-round selection in the 2020 NFL draft to the Detroit Lions for cornerback Darius Slay. Staff Final roster Preseason The Eagles' preseason schedule was announced on May 7, but was later cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Game summaries Week 1: at Washington Football Team In a near-reversal of the previous season's opener, the Eagles scored the first 17 points, only for the Washington Football Team to then shut their offense out for the remainder of the afternoon. Meanwhile, Washington's offense scored 27 unanswered points, and the defense sacked Carson Wentz eight times, recorded two interceptions, and forced three fumbles. With the loss, Philadelphia's six-game winning streak against Washington dating back to 2016 came to an end, and the Eagles lost the first game of the season for the first time since 2015. Week 2: vs. Los Angeles Rams The Eagles' struggles continued in their home opener against the Los Angeles Rams. An early fumble by Miles Sanders led to a Rams touchdown by Tyler Higbee.

Jalen Hurts's poor performance began with turning the ball over three times, one of which led to a Cowboys scoring drive. With the loss, the Eagles dropped to 4–10–1 and were eliminated from playoff contention. They also suffered double digit losses for the first time since the 2012 season. Week 17: vs. Washington Football Team While Philadelphia was already eliminated when this game was conducted, the game was still relevant to the playoffs; if the Eagles won, then the New York Giants would advance as NFC East champions, while if they lost, then Washington would win the NFC East. The game was scheduled as the final game of the regular season to ensure that the televised Sunday night football game would have playoff implications. Despite erasing an early 10-point deficit, the Eagles lost 20–14 to Washington, who clinched the NFC East and the fourth seed as a result. Philadelphia finished with a 4–11–1 overall record, their worst since the 2012 season, and were swept by Washington for the first time since the 2016 season. This loss also secured a last place finish in the NFC East for the first time since 2016. After the game, coach Doug Pederson was criticized for taking out starting quarterback Jalen Hurts in the fourth quarter for a third-string quarterback with the game still in close contention, a move more associated with preseason games that allegedly shocked the Eagles players. Some writers accused Pederson of throwing the game so that the Giants would miss the playoffs, and others accused him of tanking for a better draft spot. Pederson denied the allegations. The Eagles announced Pederson's dismissal eight days later, on January\"}]"
